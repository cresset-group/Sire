/** This is the base class of all Number ID objects. A Number
    is used to provide an object with an identifying number.
    This could be the number of a residue in a molecule, a 
    user-supplied number of a CutGroup in a molecule, or
    perhaps the automatic unique ID numbers of molecules, 
    forcefields or molecule groups that are assigned by the
    program. The key point of a Number is to provide an ID
    that can be queried and compared rapidly, and that 
    does not change as the object is moved between different
    containers. Generally an object should keep its number
    throughout its lifetime.
